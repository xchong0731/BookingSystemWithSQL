Proposal
Our object is to create a hotel booking system, which can provide the customer a convenient way to booking a room without make a phone call or send email to the frontdesk of the hotel, and also provide an efficient and security way to manager.

Based on B/S, we will divide project into two parts: frontdesk and background which serves for customer and manager respectively.
Frontdesk:
     member: book room and check situation
     manager: manage member information,  booking bill, starting time and ending time
Background:
     room information: manager can add or delete the property of rooms, such as  floor, room number.
     bill management: manager can add, delete or check the booking bill of  member.
     system maintenance: manager can delete or change member.
     
 3 steps:
1. Create hotel database management system.We assume it has 3 tables

2. Create Java project to finish the display and interactive part.

3. Use JDBC connect java and MySQL database.
